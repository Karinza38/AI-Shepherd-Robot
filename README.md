# AI-Shepherd-Robot - Grade: 18 (in a scale of 20 points)
Repository of code for the Artificial Intelligence course.

This code was made using Lejos EV3 API.

This project consisted by the creation of a program capable to give artificial inteligence
to a Lego EV3 robot in order to allow him to solve the problem described bellow:

#Problem
We should consider a table of 6x6.
The robot starts on the downer-left corner. In anywhere of the squares is placed 2 sheeps. 
Also is placed 6 barriers in 6 different sides of random squares.
The objective is to place both sheeps in the upper-right corner.
In order to do that the robot can have two different action:

  -touch the sheep: and the sheep moves 2 squares
  
  -scream to the sheep: and the seep moves 1 square
  
Another conditionant is that when one sheep is touched or listens the scream of the robot
it start moving randomly if the robot goes looses the sheep contact.
